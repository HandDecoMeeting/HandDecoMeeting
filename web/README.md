### To start the example on web
---

Due to the cross-origin resource policy(CORS), the demo site has to be launched under the conditions below.
(Not by just simply opening the .html file!)

After cloning this directory, use an http server to launch the html file.

A possible method may be

``` terminal
npx http-server
```
Other packages such as live-server are also possible.

If not installed, try
``` terminal
npm install http-server
```
Then, direct to the local server (ex. http://127.0.0.1:{port}).
